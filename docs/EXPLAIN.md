# Explaining the ghsAppWrapper

The whole point of the ghsAppWrapper is to make it easy to develop using data from the ghsApp. Although you could use just the api its self, if something changes in the api and your app breaks you have to look at the api and try to fix it yourself. With the wrapper all you need to do is update and all the methods are updated to they're moved location. For people that are more new to the world of programming it also allows you to make something using the api without having to learn how an api work.
